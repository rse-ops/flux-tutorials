The framework consists of a suite of projects, tools, and libraries which may be used to build site-custom resource managers for High Performance Computing centers. Flux is a next-generation resource manager and scheduler with many transformative capabilities like hierarchical scheduling and resource management (you can think of it as \"fractal scheduling\") and directed-graph based resource representations.\n",
