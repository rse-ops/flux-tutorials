# üåÄÔ∏è Flux Tutorials üåÄÔ∏è

This repository contains flux tutorials! It is an experiment to get ready
for testing a new lab playground where a visitor can request a notebook
to try out lab software. The repository will provide (optionally)
automated builds for containers, or just notebooks that use containers
elsewhere (e.g., Flux already has automated builds alongside the repository).
These tutorials originally came from [the officials tutorials repository](https://github.com/flux-framework/Tutorials).

## Instructions for Setup

If you want to deploy your own tutorials repository, you can use this one as a template!

### Tutorials

Each tutorial is basically a notebook and a base container, where the base
container should have jupyter installed and your tutorial software. Each tutorial
should be put under a named group, under "tutorials":

```console
tutorials/

    latest/

      # This is also optional, but it's nice to show how to build/run the container locally
      README.md
      
      # This is optional, if a base container is elsewhere it can be referenced
      Dockerfile

      # Supporting materials can go in this top level directory
      # This material you don't want to share publicly (in the UI)
      presentation.pptx
      
      # Material in this directory can be linked/shared in the playground
      public/
          presentation.pdf

      # Numbered to present a logical ordering (like a table of contents)
      notebooks/
          01-getting-started.ipynb
          02-developer-tutorial.ipynb

      # Metadata about the tutorials and resources
      tutorial.yaml
    22.04/
        ...
```

And it's up to you how to organize! In the example above we use a latest and version,
however you could also namespace to cloud providers and dates, or even HPC conferences
that you present them at. Also note the contents under each. If a `Dockerfile`
is provided in the tutorial folder, this should build the base, and this is specified
in `container.yaml`. By default, the containers will build to `ghcr.io/<org>/<repository>/<tutorial>`.
For the tutorial here, we might see `ghcr.io/rse-ops/flux-tutorial:latest`.

### Suggested Interactions

#### Environment Variables

If you are running a notebook, it's generally expected that
you'll provide the user with a browser to open a notebook. This means
we need to authenticate, which can be done by way of the container user
as a username, and a custom password from the environment. You should
provide a default password in the container (primarily for development)
but also define it as an environment variable that can be controlled
by the deployment technology. As an example, with our config here,
the variable `GLOBAL_PASSWORD` is defined in our Dockerfile,
but also can be defined on deploy for a custom password.

#### Entrypoint Command

The start of your container should generally run a notebook to demonstrate your
software. It's also recommended to post a welcome message to inform the user
of any needed credentials. As an example, the notebook here sets the password
for Jupyterlab from the environment, and prints a message to the user in the terminal:

```dockerfile
# This allows the running user to set the password on the container start
ENV GLOBAL_PASSWORD=${GLOBAL_PASSWORD}
CMD /bin/bash /welcome.sh && \
    echo "c.DummyAuthenticator.password = \"${GLOBAL_PASSWORD}\"" >> /home/fluxuser/jupyterhub_config.py && \
    PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH \
    flux start --test-size=4 /home/fluxuser/.local/bin/jupyterhub -f /home/fluxuser/jupyterhub_config.py
```

And the welcome script will show:

```console
üåÄÔ∏è Welcome to the Flux Framework RADIUSS Tutorial! üåÄÔ∏è
If you are running this locally (and can see this message)
You can open your browser to https://127.0.0.1.
We use self-signed certificates, so you can proceed.
Your login information is:

ü•ëÔ∏è user: fluxuser
ü•ëÔ∏è password: playground

Have fun! ‚≠êÔ∏èü¶ÑÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
```

### Metadata

Each tutorial folder has a `tutorial.yaml` file that will be used to deploy
the tutorial and to generate the site (with metadata). Importantly, you should
provide the name of an associated project repository on GitHub that will provide
more metadata about the project, along with labels that map to instance preferences
for each. This is currently a limited set, and will be expanded.

```yaml
title: "Flux Tutorial: 2022 for RADIUSS"
container:
  name: ghcr.io/rse-ops/flux-radiuss-aws-2022:jupyter-3.0.0
  # This should be changed for a production deployment
  env:
    name: GLOBAL_PASSWORD
    optional: true
  ports:
    - 443:443
project:
  github: flux-framework/flux-core  
notebooks:
  - name: 01-radiuss-aws-flux.ipynb
    title: Flux Jobs Tutorial
```

We currently ask for a GitHub identifier to retrieve metadata about the project.
The current assumption above is that tutorials are grouped based on similar resource needs using the same container.

### Site

The only change needed in the [docs](docs) folder is to update the [_config.yml](_config.yml)
to include your repository metadata.

### Validation

Your tutorial metadata will be validated with the [.github/workflows/main.yaml](.github/workflows/main.yaml).
More specifically, we build the site static json API that will be used by associated tools to deploy
the tutorials, and check the following:

1. Your tutorial names are all lowercase, with only special characters `-` allowed
2. A title, container, and project (with github name) are defined
3. The GitHub name only has one slash (no git@ or https, etc.)
4. The docker container needs to be pullable.
